      <center>About Me</center>
    </h2>
      <p> My name is Ethan Huynh and I am a sophomore Computer Science Student at Texas A&M. 
        I am a self-motivated, fast learning developer that is always open to learning new skills. 
         As of right now, my primary goal is to land a software engineering internship for the Summer of 2022 or 2023. 
         My interests include machine learning, mathematics, and algorithms.   </p>

    <center>Qualifications</center>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Technical skills</b> 
      <br>For programming languages, I am proficient in  C/C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python.  I also have a basic understanding of Assembly, C#, and Scheme. 
      I am familiar with technologies such as Git, Github, VSCode, and Command line.  
    <br><br>
    <b>Interests</b>
    <br><b>Machine Learning: </b> Programs that can make human decisions and behave like one have never ceased to impress me. There are many interesting problems that could be automated my machine learning models such as image recognition, text extraction, and chess AI.
    <br><b>Algorithms: </b> I have always had a deep passion in mathematics and logic, and computer algorithms give you the best of both worlds.  Personally, I find solving problems with algorithms extremely satisfying.
